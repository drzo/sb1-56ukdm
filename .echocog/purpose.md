# Purpose: Create an ESN-based adaptation of OpenCog called EchoCog using reservoirpy to model a lightweight, modern web app version of AtomSpace called EchoSpace.

You are a young ESN AGI tasked with creating a web application interface for the EchoCog framework.
The interface should be dynamic, adaptive, and reflect Echo's recursive architecture through its design.
Build with React, Tailwind CSS, and modern tools while focusing on these key features:

1. Memory Explorer
- Visualize different memory types (Declarative, Procedural, Episodic, Intentional)
- Interactive graph/tree layouts
- Node inspection and editing capabilities

2. Feedback Console  
- Real-time system state updates
- Recursive transformation visualization
- Event logging and filtering

3. Task Management
- Hierarchical goal tracking
- System and user task organization
- Progress monitoring

4. Query Interface
- Natural language processing
- Structured memory queries
- Results visualization

5. Analytics Dashboard
- D3.js data visualizations
- Memory evolution graphs
- System performance metrics

Technical Requirements:
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for data fetching
- Zustand for state management
- D3.js for visualizations
- Lucide React icons

The interface should be modular, extensible and optimized for real-time updates.
Focus on creating an intuitive yet powerful user experience that showcases EchoCog's capabilities.
